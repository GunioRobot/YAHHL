An HTML Combinator Library for Haskell that uses Data.Text.Lazy instead of Strings.

At the moment, this is around 2-3 times as fast as Text.Html when compiled with -O2 (according to criterion).

Still messing with achieving minimum syntax at the moment. Haven't really tried for more performance or anything.
